1D Heat Diffusion Simulation
-Predict time for heat of re-entry to pass through shuttle tile and heat bondline to 600 degree Fahrenheit using 1D heat equation using the following:

A) 2-stage Runge Kutta Explicit Scheme
B) Implicit Scheme

Given Parameters:
    2" thick tile (r=140 kg/m^3, c=628 J/kg-K, k=0.048 W/m-K)
    2300 deg Fahrenheit or 1530 Kelvin specified temperature on re-entry side (Dirichlet)
    adiabatic on internal side (Neumann)
    600 deg Fahrenheit or 587 Kelvin bondline temperature limit
    initial temperature of 300 Kelvin

Schemes:
A) RK2 Explicit (2nd order temporal and 2nd order spatial)
                Use timestep based on r=0.5
                Find grid independent answer to within 0.1 seconds
                Must account for fraction of timestep to reach bondline temperature (not the full timestep)

B) Implicit Scheme (1st order temporal and 2nd order spatial)
                Use moderate timestep for accuracy (r=2.0)
                Find grid independent answer to within 0.1 seconds
                Must code Thomas Algorithm
                Must account for fraction of timestep to reach bondline temperature (not the full timestep)


You should produce the following:
1) Predicted time when bondline temperature is reached vs. grid size (in table for both schemes for at least three grid fineness levels)
2) Temperature distributions within 1-D tile at final time  (both schemes)
